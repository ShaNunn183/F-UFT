Abstract:  
The Fractal-Unified Field Theory (F-UFT) identifies the vacuum state of the electromagnetic field, in the Lorenz gauge, as a physical, relativistic, fractal aether with Hausdorff dimension D ≈ 1.830 ± 0.008. This dimension emerges naturally from the projection geometry of the E₈ root lattice onto observable 4D branches and is identical (within measurement error) to the universal fractal dimension repeatedly observed in cosmic web filamentarity, quark–gluon plasma (QGP) initial fluctuations, fully developed turbulence, and optimized biological branching networks. The Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect is shown to be the laboratory-scale demonstration that the Lorenz-gauge four-potential A^μ is a real, physical displacement field of this fractal aether, even in regions where E = B = 0.

We derive the power spectrum of vector-potential fluctuations in the fractal aether as P(f) ∝ f^{−(5 − D)} ≈ f^{−3.17}, identical to the long-memory noise observed in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves, solar-wind turbulence, and laboratory plasma experiments. A precise, falsifiable prediction is made: ultra-precise, long-baseline AB interferometry (cold-atom or superconducting ring) performed in a controlled turbulent background will exhibit phase drift with power spectral index −3.17 ± 0.05, directly measurable with integration times ≳ 10⁴ s. Confirmation would constitute the first laboratory detection of the fractal structure of the electromagnetic vacuum and resurrect the aether—not as a classical medium, but as the observable manifestation of the Entanglium’s collapse into classical spacetime.
